## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned how to better use flexbox and table implementation and incresing space between table rows.

### Continued development
The code is bulky without the use of variables. I would revisit this project to change some some implementations to reduce the code size and add the marks dynamically from the data.json file.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me for reading html tag and css properties documentation. 
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is an amazing page to clear most of my doubts while coding.
